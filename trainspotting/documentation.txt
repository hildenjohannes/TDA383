The map has six critical sections, each critical section represented by a semaphore.  When a train is about to enter a critical section it tries to acquire the semaphore. When the train exits the critical section the train releases the semaphore. The train only releases the semaphore if it was the train itself that acquired it. This means that if a train tries to enter a critical section where there already is a another train, the first train has to stop. When the other train has left the critical section the first train is allowed to enter.

Since trains are not allowed in the same critical sections they will not crash. Some parts of the train track is not covered be any critical section. At the lower part of the map the train can choose between two tracks to reach the lower train station. The lower track is not covered by any critical section. The train will always default to the upper track, but if there already is a train on the upper track the train will choose the lower track. Since there is only two trains in the program, it is safe to enter the lower track when the upper track is occupied by a train. The same strategy is implemented for the upper station.

A similar strategy is also implemented for the middle section where the railway is double-tracked. The train will always default to the upper track (the shortest route), but if there already is a train on the upper track it will choose the lower track.

In this double-tracked middle part of the map there is a possibility for one train to overtake the other train. This is made possible by making the upper part to a critical section (section/semaphore 3). If a train is in this section, the other train will choose the lower track. If it is faster than the first train, it will overtake it.

The critical sections is between the following sensors:
Section 0: 14,3 <-> 19,7
Section 1: 8,5 <-> 10,8 and 6,7 <-> 10,7
Section 2: 15,7 and 15,8 <-> 12,9 and 13,10
Section 3: 18,9 <-> 2,9
Section 4: 7,9 and 6,10 <-> 5,11 and 4,13
Section 5: 1,11 <-> 14,11


The maximum speed of our solution that we guarantee works is 15. The reason for this is simply that some sensors are located too close to switches.

We tested our solution by running multiple instances of the program at different speeds, and with a faster simulation speed than the default. We also tested our program by simulating corner cases, we manually placed train at sections where they normally would not start, with extremely slow and fast speeds.




Documentation.
In addition to working code you need to provide a convincing argument why your solution is correct.
You must document your solution with a plain text file.
Give a high-level description of your program and then go
into detail about all pieces of code that are essential for correctness.
The documentation should include everything needed for easy understanding of the solution.

In particular we demand that your documentation contains discussion of:
Placement of the sensors
Choice of critical sections
Maximum train speed and the reason for it
How you tested your solution
