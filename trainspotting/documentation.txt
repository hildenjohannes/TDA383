enter(): To enter a critical section and if this is not possible, wait in line until it gets awoken, and then enter.

tryEnter(): To try entering a critical section. If this is possible, enter and return true. If not, return false. This method never waits.

leave(): To leave a critical section and send a signal to awake the first (if any) thread waiting in line for that section.

We need 6 condition variables, one for every monitor (and one monitor for every critical section). Each section needs to be able to make trains wait and also signal that it is okay to enter.
